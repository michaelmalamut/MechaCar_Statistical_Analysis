## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

As we can see in the multiple linear regression, the two variables, vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a statistical significance on MPG. Both variables had p-values below the significance level of 0.05%.

The multiple r-suare value is 0.7149 and the p-value is velow the significance level of 0.05%, this is enough sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (The slope of the linear model is not zero).
