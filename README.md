# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to understand the production data.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

As we can see in the multiple linear regression, the two variables, vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a statistical significance on MPG. Both variables had p-values below the significance level of 0.05%.

The multiple r-suare value is 0.7149 and the p-value is velow the significance level of 0.05%, this is enough sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (The slope of the linear model is not zero).

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

* The current manufacturing data meets the design specification of not exceeding 100 psi for Lot 1 and Lot 2.
* Lot3 does not meet the design specification with a variance of 170 psi which exceeds the 100 threshold for this excercise.

## T-Test on Suspension Coils

* The p-value of the suspension coilâ€™s PSI is 0.06028, which is above the significance level of 0.05% and therefore demonstrates that it is not statistically different from the mean population PSI results.

* The p-value for Lot1 is larger than the 0.05 significance level.

* The p-value for Lot2 is larger than the 0.05 significance level.

* The p-value for Lot3 is smaller than the 0.05 significance level.
